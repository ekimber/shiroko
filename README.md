# shiroko [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ekimber/shiroko.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ekimber/shiroko)
Clojure Data Prevalence library. 

Leiningen dependencies:

     [org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
     [ekimber/shiroko "0.1.0"]

## Usage

Create a ref to be persisted.

    (def x (ref 0))

Create a transaction that modifies the ref.

    (defn add-to-x [a]
      (ref-set x (+ x a)))

Initialise the persistent store with a list of refs (these will be used to make snapshots).  Then
use `apply-transaction` to make changes to the refs.  It returns an async channel that will contain
the result of the transaction. The `batch-size` option determines how many transactions will be stored
in each journal file.

    (let [base (init-db :ref-list [x] :batch-size 1000)]
      (dotimes [n 10]
        (println (<!! (apply-transaction inc-x)))))

The transactions will be persisted and replayed next time `init-db` is called.

Pass the returned persistent system to `take-snapshot` to take a snapshot of the refs.  The
latest snapshot is loaded at the next initialisation. This will improve start-up time when there
are a large number of transactions.

        (take-snapshot base)
